# Problem 0

# random.randrange( limit ) is a python function that returns a
# random integer in the range [0, limit)

# Write a function that will create and return a list of size n that
# is filled with random integers in the range [0, limit)

# Problem 1
# Write a function that takes a list of non-negative integer
# values and returns a string of a bar graph representation of the list.
# The length of each bar should be the same as the value at that index.
# That means if g[0] = 9, then the first bar should have a length of 9.

# The code below should have this output:
# 0: =========

# 2: =====
# 3: ===
# 4: =
# 5: =====
# 6: =========
# 7: =====
# 8: =======

# Problem 2

# Write a function that returns the average of the
# values in a list. You may assume that the argument
# provided is a list that only contains numbers.

    avg = 0
    return avg

# Problem 4

# Write a function that returns the mode (most frequently
# appearing value) of a given list.
# It should only return a single value, even if there are
# multiple modes, just return one of them.

#==================================================
# Problem 5

# Write a function that keeps track of the frequencies of values
# from a list containing only integers.
# For example, if the provided list only contained 0s and 1s,
# and there were 8 0s and 23 1s, then the fucntion should
# return this list: [8, 23]
# It is important to understand that each index in the new
# list represents a value from the parameter list. So the new
# list needs to be as large as the biggest value in the parameter.
def list_counts(g, max_value):
    #This will create a new list with a size of max_value filled with 0s
    counts = [0] * max_value
    return counts

# Should print
# [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 1, 1, 2]
test_counts = list_counts( test, 10 )

# create a new list of 10 random values in the range [0, 5)
# print that list
# YOUR CODE HERE


# create a list that correctly counts all the values in
# the new list you just made.
# print that list
# YOUR CODE HERE

# End Problem 5

#==================================================
# Problem 6
# If you use bar_graph on a list with sufficiently large
# values, you'll have a problem with the bars taking up
# more than one line.

# Write a new bar_graph function that will draw a scaled bar
# graph. It should take an argument for the scale factor,
# such that 1 piece of a bar represents 1 quantity equal
# to the scale factor.

def bar_graph_scaled(g, scale_factor):
    s = ''
    return s

print(('=' * 10) + "Problem 6" + ('=' * 10))
# Should print:
# 0: =====
# 1: ======
# 2: =
scale_test = [500, 670, 125]
print(bar_graph_scaled(scale_test, 100))

# now let's try it on a list with very large values

# Problem 7

# random.randrange() distributes numbers evenly, meaning
# that every possible random value has an equal chance
# of being returned.

# How could you test how evenly random.randrange()
# distributes the results?
# print out your answer as a string
print(('=' * 10) + "Problem 7" + ('=' * 10))

# Write code below that performs the test you described.
